		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of
			bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano,
			tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other
			ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial setting, using a
			wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			One of the simplest and most traditional pizzas is the Margherita,
			which is topped with tomatoes or tomato sauce, mozzarella, and
			basil.
		</p>
